<!--Ajax, which stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, is a technique used in
 web development to send and receive data from a web server asynchronously without 
 needing to reload the entire page. This allows for dynamic and interactive web 
 applications where certain parts of the page can be updated without the need
  for a full page refresh.

With Ajax, you can make requests to a server from client-side JavaScript code
 and handle the response without interrupting the user's interaction with the 
 web page. This is commonly used for tasks such as fetching data from a server, 
 submitting form data, or performing actions like deleting or updating records
  in a database.

Pushing values into an array in Ajax typically refers to adding data received 
from the server into an array in the client-side JavaScript code. When an Ajax 
request is made and the server responds with data, you can handle that data in
 the success callback function of the Ajax request. Within this callback
  function, you can manipulate the received data, such as pushing it into an
   array for further processing or displaying it on the web page.-->
